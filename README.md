# Obsidian's Wyrd

And amazing. So I'm making this theme weird, too.

Wyrd is a purple-hued, low-contrast theme for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md).

## Features

- Visual balance between light and dark modes!
- Custom font selection `@import`ed through Google Fonts!
- All fonts scale with the current `--editor-font-size`!
  - Including headings (!!)

### Planned Features

- [ ] Snippet to make font selection locally available for offline use
  - Necessary, as some fonts from google contain 50+ variations, and would make the CSS file absurdly large
- [ ] Style Settings compatability
- [ ] 

## Notes

- Long headings don't have the gradient pattern repeated
  - I'm contemplating fixing this, though doing so will require making the gradient more dynamically sized

## Todos

- [ ] Bold styling
- [ ] Italic styling
- Link styling
  - [ ] Internal link
  - [ ] Unresolved internal link
  - [ ] External link

### Needs fixing

- [ ] Links disappear in headings
- [ ]
