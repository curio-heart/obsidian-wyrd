# Obsidian's Wyrd

And amazing. So I'm making this theme weird, too.

Wyrd is a purple-hued, low-contrast theme for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md).

## Features

- Visual balance between light and dark modes!
- Custom font selection `@import`ed through Google Fonts!
- All fonts scale with the current `--editor-font-size`!
  - Including headings (!!)

### Planned

- [ ] Snippet to make font selection locally available for offline use
  - Necessary, as some fonts contain 50+ variations
- [ ] Style Settings compatability
- [ ]
